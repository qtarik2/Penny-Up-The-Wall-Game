So After I Stop Follow Coin

I made a new bar with her ("MaxPosUI") and ("MinPosUI")
i mean tha bar have first position and the last position
 
in scene you will see 2 sphere with yellow collow the first sphere called ("MinPos") her position is the minimum position of the coin
and the second sphere called ("Max Position") her position is the maximum position of the coin

so what i do is calculate the percentage of the coin between (max and min pos)
and after that i instatitate new image (the icon of the player or boss) and i set the percantage to the image between the MaxPosUI
and MinPosUI to the percentage of the coin calculated

Its advantages :

	1- Smoothly Position Of The UI icon
	2- Avoid Mistake By Making clamp Of The UI icon Position
	(if the coin position larger than max position make the max of the icon is the max of MaxPosUI)

How To Use :

	1- You can adjust The Max and Min Position Of the Bar UI
	(By Editing The Positions In (" MaxPosUI ") and (" MinPosUI "))

	2- You can adjust The Max and Min Position Of the Coin Of The Coin In Space World
	(By Editing The Positions In (" MaxPos ") and ("MinPos") (Yellow Sphere))

Thats 'it, Thank You !!
